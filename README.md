## 📂 Mission Profile

**LensNode** is not a traditional photography studio. We are a **Tactical Visual Firm**. 

We operate at the intersection of high-performance software engineering and elite visual production. This repository serves as the public documentation for the **LensNode Platform**, a custom-built digital infrastructure designed to manage distributed creative operatives ("Cells"), streamline asset delivery, and execute high-precision visual deployments.

> *"We utilize military and technology-driven terminology to signify precision, reliability, and elite skill."*

* **Base Command:** Centralized management in Lake Charles handling logistics and client uplinks.

### 🚀 Node Initialization Protocol (Expansion)
We are currently engineering the framework for **Franchise Nodes**. This protocol will allow elite operatives in other sectors (Houston, Austin, New Orleans) to initialize their own LensNode branch using our proprietary software and branding infrastructure.
